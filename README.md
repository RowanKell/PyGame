# My PyGame
This is a repo for testing making games with pygame.
## How to run
1. Clone this github and be sure to have python installed and the pygame package installed
1. To run, run the commad ```python -m main```
## Controls
1. Use arrow keys to move
1. Clicking ESC will close the game and stop the program
## How to play
1. Use the arrow keys to navigate the screen and avoid enemies
1. if any of the enemies touch you, you die and the program terminates
1. Clouds provide shelter from enemies, and hence hiding in them makes you immune
## Issues
1. If you have issues with sizes, speeds, etc. look in main.py for size / speed variables and adjust as needed
1. ```clock.tick(60)``` sets the default framerate to 60 fps. If you wish to change this value, just know that speeds will also change as the positions update with each frame
